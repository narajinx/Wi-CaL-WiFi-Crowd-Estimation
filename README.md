# Wi-CaL: WiFi Crowd Estimation
Wi-CaL is a simultaneous crowd estimation system including crowd counting and crowd localization through WiFi sensing and machine learning. We distribute our datasets, codes for conventional machine learning and deep learning, to enable the people interested in wireless sensing to practically test the system.
